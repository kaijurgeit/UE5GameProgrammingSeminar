# Unreal Engine 5 Game Programming Seminar
This Unreal Engine 5.5 Project is a game with the working title *Rae* and serves as a learning resource for an Unreal Engine 5 game programming seminar.

## Getting started

At the state of this commit, the project is based on **Unreal Engine 5.5**. I recommend using this version, but you should be able to open it with what you already have installed. In order to run the project:

1. Clone the repository or unzip the project
2. Open Rae.uproject with Rider, or right-click "Generate Visual Studio project files" -> open with Visual Studio
3. Build from source
4. Open Rae.uproject
5. "Add Feature or Content Pack..." (+): StarterContent and ThirdPerson (Blueprint)
6. Restart the project
7. Start learning by doing


```
git clone https://github.com/kaijurgeit/UE5ProgrammingSeminar.git
```

If this does not work: Right-click and open Rae.uproject with Rider, or right-click, "Generate Visual Studio project files" -> open with Visual Studio to build the project from source. You can also delete all generated files by double-clicking the "cleanup.bat" and perform a clean re-build subsequently.

## Prerequisites
You need to able to run Unreal Engine 5 and to build C++ projects. The preferred operation system is Windows.

### Unreal Engine 5 Installation

### Build Unreal Engine C++ Projects
- C++ for Windows users: [Setting Up Visual Studio](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/setting-up-visual-studio-development-environment-for-cplusplus-projects-in-unreal-engine)
- C++ for Mac users: [Supporting Universal Binaries for macOS](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/supporting-universal-binaries-for-macos-in-unreal-engine)
- C++ for Linux users: [Linux Development Quickstart](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/linux-development-quickstart-for-unreal-engine)

### Rider
You can use the IDE you prefer. I'm using [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/rider), which is free for non-commercial use, and the [One Dark Them](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11938-one-dark-theme), which is available for Rider, Visual Studio and VSCode. If you want you can use Rider and/or that seem to make it easier for you to follow along.
